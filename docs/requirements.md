## Domain Model

The TeachMeWell application allows Students to rate and view Professors' ratings. Each rating is described by a value between 1-5 and a comment,
describing the professors. Each student belongs to one or more faculties and is enrolled in one or more courses which can be taught by one or more 
faculties and has its own subjects that are taught by one or more professors. A professor is described by their acronym, name and Department. 
A student is described by their student number and name. Each faculty, course and subject has their own acronym/code and name.
